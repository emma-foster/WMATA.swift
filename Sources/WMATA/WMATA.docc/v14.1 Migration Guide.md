## Station Names

WMATA has [officially changed the names](https://www.wmata.com/about/news/Metro-to-implement-station-name-change-at-five-stations.cfm) of the following stations:

- White Flint is now North Bethesda
- Largo Town Center is now Downtown Largo
- Tysons Corner is now Tysons
- Prince Georgeâ€™s Plaza is now Hyattsville Crossing
- West Falls Church-VT/UVA is now West Falls Church-VT

Therefore, the following changes have been made:

- ``Station/princeGeorgesPlaza`` has been deprecated. Use ``Station/hyattsvilleCrossing``.
- ``Station/largoTownCenter`` is now deprecated. Use ``Station/downtownLargo``.
- ``Station/tysonsCorner`` is now deprecated. Use ``Station/tysons``.
- ``Station/whiteFlint`` was already deprecated. Use ``Station/northBethesda``.
- ``Station/allOpen`` returns ``Station/hyattsvilleCrossing``, ``Station/downtownLargo`` and ``Station/tysons`` instead of their deprecated counterparts.
- ``Station/lines`` returns ``Station/hyattsvilleCrossing``, ``Station/downtownLargo`` and ``Station/tysons`` instead of their deprecated counterparts.

Xcode will provide a warning and the option to rename these deprecated values automatically.

The following values for ``Station/name`` have been updated:

- ``Station/hyattsvilleCrossing`` returns `Hyattsville Crossing`.
- ``Station/downtownLargo`` returns `Downtown Largo`.
- ``Station/tysons`` returns `Tysons`.
- ``Station/westFallsChurch`` returns `West Falls Church-VT`.
